## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Headless workflow execution
r[n8nclone.workflow_execution.headless.run] The system MUST let operators run a saved workflow without starting the TUI.

#### Scenario: Run saved workflow
r[n8nclone.workflow_execution.headless.run.saved]
- GIVEN a workflow exists in the configured store
- WHEN the operator runs it through the headless command
- THEN the system loads the workflow, executes its nodes, and reports the completed run

#### Scenario: Missing workflow
r[n8nclone.workflow_execution.headless.run.missing]
- GIVEN no saved workflow matches the requested name
- WHEN the operator runs it through the headless command
- THEN the system reports a clear load error without starting the TUI

### Requirement: Headless exit status
r[n8nclone.workflow_execution.headless.exit_status] The system MUST return a deterministic process result for headless workflow runs.

#### Scenario: Successful workflow exits successfully
r[n8nclone.workflow_execution.headless.exit_status.success]
- GIVEN every node in the workflow completes successfully
- WHEN the headless run finishes
- THEN the command exits successfully

#### Scenario: Failed workflow exits with failure
r[n8nclone.workflow_execution.headless.exit_status.failure]
- GIVEN at least one node in the workflow fails
- WHEN the headless run finishes
- THEN the command exits with failure and identifies the failed node

### Requirement: Headless run summary
r[n8nclone.workflow_execution.headless.summary] The system SHOULD expose headless run summaries in human-readable and machine-readable forms.

#### Scenario: Text summary
r[n8nclone.workflow_execution.headless.summary.text]
- GIVEN a headless run reaches a terminal state
- WHEN the operator requests default output
- THEN the system prints a concise text summary with run status, node count, failures, and cache hits

#### Scenario: JSON summary
r[n8nclone.workflow_execution.headless.summary.json]
- GIVEN a headless run reaches a terminal state
- WHEN the operator requests JSON output
- THEN the system prints a structured summary that automation can parse deterministically

### Requirement: Headless run history
r[n8nclone.workflow_execution.headless.history] The system SHOULD persist headless run records using the same history model as TUI runs.

#### Scenario: Persist headless run
r[n8nclone.workflow_execution.headless.history.persist]
- GIVEN a headless run reaches a terminal state
- WHEN persistence is available
- THEN the system stores a run record that appears in recent run history

### Requirement: Headless error handling
r[n8nclone.workflow_execution.headless.errors] The system MUST handle headless load and execution errors without corrupting persisted workflow state.

#### Scenario: Load failure preserves store
r[n8nclone.workflow_execution.headless.errors.load_failure]
- GIVEN the requested workflow cannot be loaded
- WHEN the headless command fails
- THEN the system leaves saved workflows unchanged and reports the error
